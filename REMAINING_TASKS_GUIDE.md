## 🔄 Remaining Tasks (4 items - Medium/Low Priority)

### 1. ⚠️ **Remove Router Duplication** (todo-10)
**Priority**: Medium | **Risk**: HIGH | **Effort**: Large (2-3 days)

**Current State**:
- App uses **BOTH expo-router AND React Navigation**
- `package.json` has `"main": "expo-router/entry"`
- Most screens use React Navigation
- Some components use `useRouter()` from expo-router

**Why It's Risky**:
- Changing entry point could break app startup
- Requires testing all navigation flows
- Could affect deep linking, authentication flow
- Needs coordinated updates across 15+ files

**Recommendation**: 
- ✅ **Defer until after production testing of current fixes**
- Consider phased approach:
  1. Audit all expo-router usage
  2. Create migration plan
  3. Test on dev/staging extensively
  4. Feature flag the change
  5. Monitor for navigation issues

**Steps When Ready**:
```bash
# 1. Remove expo-router from screens
# Files to update: 15 files found with expo-router imports
- src/screens/HomeScreen.tsx (6 uses)
- src/screens/LiveScreen.tsx
- src/screens/ChatScreen.tsx
- ...all 15 files

# 2. Update package.json
# Change: "main": "expo-router/entry"
# To: "main": "node_modules/expo/AppEntry.js"

# 3. Test all navigation flows
- Tab navigation
- Stack navigation
- Deep linking
- Authentication redirects
- Guest user flows
```

---

### 2. 🎨 **Centralize Design Tokens** (todo-17)
**Priority**: Medium | **Risk**: MEDIUM | **Effort**: Large (3-4 days)

**Current State**:
- `src/styles/discordTheme.ts` exists with comprehensive tokens
- **153 hardcoded colors in HomeScreen.tsx alone**
- Similar hardcoding in other screens

**Impact**:
- Improves consistency
- Easier theming
- Reduces magic numbers

**Steps**:
```bash
# 1. Create theme hook
# src/hooks/useTheme.ts
import { DiscordTheme } from '../styles/discordTheme';
export const useTheme = () => DiscordTheme;

# 2. Refactor screens one by one (start with high-traffic)
Priority order:
1. HomeScreen.tsx (153 hardcoded colors)
2. ChatScreen.tsx
3. LiveScreen.tsx
4. ProfileScreen.tsx
5. NotificationsScreen.tsx

# 3. Replace hardcoded values
Before: backgroundColor: '#313338'
After: backgroundColor: theme.background.primary

Before: color: '#f2f3f5'
After: color: theme.text.primary

Before: padding: 16
After: padding: theme.spacing.lg

# 4. Visual regression testing
- Screenshot before/after
- Test dark mode
- Check all screens
```

**Recommendation**:
- ✅ **Do this AFTER navigation is stable**
- ✅ **One screen at a time with visual QA**
- ✅ **Create theme hook first for easier adoption**

---

### 3. 📊 **Host Analytics Dashboard** (todo-23)
**Priority**: Optional | **Risk**: LOW | **Effort**: Medium (1-2 days)

**What It Would Include**:
- Stream performance metrics (viewers, duration, quality)
- Participant tracking (joins, leaves, activity)
- Moderation actions (mutes, kicks, bans)
- Revenue metrics (virtual gifts, subscriptions)

**Why It's Optional**:
- Not blocking stability
- More of a feature than a fix
- Can be built incrementally

**When to Build**:
- After remaining stabilization tasks
- When you want to add host-facing features
- As part of monetization improvements

---

### 4. 🧪 **Expand Smoke Tests** (todo-24)
**Priority**: Low | **Risk**: LOW | **Effort**: Medium (2-3 days)

**Current State**:
- `run-smoke-tests.sh` exists (179 lines)
- Basic tests in `__tests__/` directory

**What to Add**:
```bash
# 1. Authentication flow tests
- Guest user creation
- Phone auth flow
- Social login (Google, Apple)
- Session persistence

# 2. Stream lifecycle tests  
- Create stream
- Join as viewer
- Leave stream
- End stream
- Cleanup verification

# 3. Messaging tests
- Send message
- Receive message
- Real-time sync
- Offline queue

# 4. Firebase rules validation
- Use validate-firestore-rules.js
- Test permission scenarios
- Guest user restrictions
- Security rules edge cases
```

**Recommendation**:
- ✅ **Add tests incrementally as bugs are found**
- ✅ **Focus on areas with most production issues**
- ✅ **Integrate into CI/CD pipeline**
